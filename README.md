# thesis

This repository provides the source codes and outcomes presented in the PhD thesis entitled "xxxxx" presented on xx/xx/2025 in Universit√© Polytechnique Hauts-de-France.

- the **abms** directory provides the agent-based model and simulation coded in NetLogo;
- the **abms-observer** directory provides the abms observer, supposed to launch both the abms and the software application under evaluation (in this case, the **webpage**);
- the **process-mining** directory provides the source code for the data mining technique that finds patterns between the motion sensors turning on and off (and for how long) and informing the abms;
- the **auxiliary** directory 
- the **interaction-log-data** directory provides the outcome from the interaction between the abms and the software application under evaluation;
- the **simulation-log-data** directory provides the outcome from the simulation executed in the abms in NetLogo;
- the **qinu-measures** directory provides the outcome of the measurements for the selected QinU characteristics;
- the **webpage** directory provides the source code for the software application evaluated in the proof of concept.
